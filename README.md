# GettingAndCleaningData
## Course project repo for Getting and cleaning data

This run_analysis script follows these steps:

* Reads the files needed.
* Merges files.
* Adds a new field to denote activity names.
* Renames every variable's name.
* Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. (** Please note that the last 7 rows in features.txt are ignored, since they are calculating the ANGLE between the two vectors. **)
* Creates a new data set to the hardrive.

Please note that you can modify this script so that you don't bother typing many directories.

To use this script, just source it and call all the functions in order with proper arguments.
